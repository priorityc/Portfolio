<h2>👩‍💻 My Journey into Web Development</h2>
<p>
I’m Petya Dimitrova — a Computing and IT student with a passion for building thoughtful digital experiences. My journey into web development began during a difficult chapter in my life, when I realized I wanted a career that brings joy and meaning, not just a paycheck.  
<br><br>
Since childhood, I’ve been drawn to design and art — anything that makes people feel something. That curiosity led me to explore what lies behind the beautiful websites we all use. After completing a few introductory courses, I enrolled in the Purple Beard Bootcamp, which became my first real step into tech.  
<br><br>
From there, I’ve taken many small but meaningful steps: building prototypes, experimenting with frameworks, and deepening my skills through my academic journey with The Open University. Each project has helped me grow not just as a developer, but as a creative problem-solver with a people-first mindset.
</p>

  <h3> My Approach to Problem Solving</h3>
  <p>
    I’m naturally detail-oriented and persistent, and I approach every project with deep focus and responsibility. Like most developers, I often encounter challenging bugs or moments where the code feels stuck — but I never give up.  
    <br><br>
    My problem-solving methodology involves thorough review, trace analysis, and identifying the root cause with care and precision. I believe that persistence, curiosity, and structured debugging are key to building reliable and meaningful digital experiences.
